  ventureverse: {
    url: "https://ventureverse.l1chain.io",
    chainId: 3461364,
    accounts: { mnemonic: "..." }
  }
}

// 2. Deploy existing contracts (no code changes)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ventureverse

// 3. Update frontend RPC endpoint
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://ventureverse.l1chain.io");
```

**Migration Effort**: 1-2 hours for most projects

#### To Sui
```move
// Complete rewrite required
// 1. Learn Move language
// 2. Redesign around object model
// 3. Rewrite all smart contracts
// 4. Update frontend to use Sui SDK
// 5. Test new paradigms thoroughly

// Example: ERC20 → Sui Coin
// Before (Solidity):
mapping(address => uint256) balances;
